### User Story 8, Favorite Indicator
- [x] done

As a visitor
I see a favorite indicator in my navigation bar
The favorite indicator shows a count of pets in my favorites list
I can see this favorite indicator from any page in the application

#### Notes: 

A VISITOR can vote a pet as favorite, and because we have no "users", I think PETS will need a column in their table to say they are a FAVORITE. 

  - [x] Add favorite indicator in the nav bar
  <!-- - [x] Add column 'favorite:boolean' to  pets table -->
  <!--rails generate migration add_favorite_to_pets favorite:boolean-->
<!--rails db:migrate-->
  <!-- - [x] pet[:favorite] = false by default -->
